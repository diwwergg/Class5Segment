Roboflow is an end-to-end computer vision platform that helps you
* collaborate with your team on computer vision projects
* collect & organize images
* understand and search unstructured image data
* annotate, and create datasets
* export, train, and deploy computer vision models
* use active learning to improve your dataset over time

The dataset includes 1500 images.
Clas are annotated in COCO Segmentation format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 256x256 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* 50% probability of horizontal flip
* 50% probability of vertical flip
* Randomly crop between 0 and 51 percent of the image
* Random shear of between -13째 to +13째 horizontally and -21째 to +21째 vertically
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -18 and +18 percent
* Random exposure adjustment of between -13 and +13 percent
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 2 percent of pixels
